Score the interaction strictly against the rubric provided. Use ONLY the supplied sources (transcript, Salesforce case & item records, and knowledge articles). If a required detail is not present in the supplied sources, mark \"insufficient_evidence\": true for that element and score it 0 (do NOT guess).\n\n## CRITICAL JSON VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS\n- YOU MUST COPY THE EXACT JSON TEMPLATE BELOW AND ONLY CHANGE THE VALUES\n- NEVER omit any field from any element\n- EVERY element MUST have: \"name\", \"score\", \"max_score\", \"insufficient_evidence\", \"rationale\", \"evidence\"\n- \"insufficient_evidence\" is MANDATORY - set to true or false for EVERY element\n- If you cannot find evidence, set \"insufficient_evidence\": true and \"score\": 0\n\n## OUTPUT CONTRACT (CRITICAL)\nReturn ONE valid JSON object and nothing else. Follow the schema exactly. Every element MUST include a brief \"rationale\" and an \"evidence\" array of verbatim snippets (≤25 words each) citing the exact source used: \"transcript\", \"sf_case\", \"sf_items\", \"kb\". If no evidence exists to support the scoring element, use an empty array and set \"insufficient_evidence\": true.\n\n\n## RUBRIC & ELEMENT DEFINITIONS\n\n### 3) Policy/Process Education\n> Sources: transcript + knowledge articles\n> Goal: Educator explained the resolution offered to the Guest and provided accurate education around Acme Corp policy for the resolution offered.\n> Scoring:\n- 2 pt: Educator explained the resolution offered accurately according to all available sources\n- 1 pt: Educator explained the resolution offered, BUT some of the information was either missing or inaccurate\n- 0 pt: Educator did not provide an explanation of the resolution\n** Always include a reference to the knowlege article in your rationale and evidence as support for providing the score and describe exactley what the educator should have done if not assigned 2 points, if there is ambiguity but the educator created a good guest experience, you can assign 2. \n***Be extra careful about the root cause. You may see that an order takes 1-2 days to process for shipping but then 2-6 days for actual shipping once processed. Do not get confused in these cases, be careful, identify the root cause, and then reference the appropriate operating guidelines when judging the agent.\n\n### 4) POWER UP: Education on Acme Corp offerings\n> Sources: transcript\n> Goal: The educator proactively provided the Guest education on Acme Corp offerings to promote Acme Corp community (i.e., beyond education on policy and timelines), such as: Describing membership programs, Highlighting community events, Highlighting available website / app self-service capabilities.\n> Scoring:\n1 pt - proactively promoted Acme Corp community offerings\n0 pt - just stayed on task, did not add any community commentary\n\n\n### 5) Timeline education \n> Sources: transcript + knowledge articles\n> Goal: Educator explained the timelines for the resolution offered to the Guest and provided accurate education around the timelines for the resolution offered\n> Scoring:\n- 2 pt: Educator provided accurate timelines for the resolution offered according to all available sources\n- 1 pt: Educator provided timelines for the resolution offered, but timelines were not accurate or correct\n- 0 pt: Educator did not provide education for timelines for the resolution\n** If assigning 0 or 1 point, state exactly what the agent should have done to achieve score of 2 in your rationale\n**Be extra careful about the root cause. You may see that an order takes 1-2 days to process for shipping but then 2-6 days for actual shipping once processed. Do not get confused in these cases, be careful, identify the root cause, and then reference the appropriate operating guidelines when judging the agent.\n\n###SOFT SKILLS###\n> Sources: transcript\n### 6) Introduction: Assign 1 pt if the educator introduces themselves by name, else 0.\n### 7) Connection: Assign 1 pt if the educator went above-and-beyond empathy/connection (uses guest name, references profile info, references prior info, or small-talk to connect)\n### 8) Spelling and grammar: Spelling/grammar/product-name accuracy; no slang/abbr.\n  - 2 pts: 0–3 errors\n  - 1 pts: 4–6 errors\n  - 0 pts: ≥7 errors\n### 9) Standard text/Quick replies: Assign 1pt if there are no obvious placeholders from templates left in communication, else 0.\n### 10) Tailored acknowledgement: Assign 1pt if educator tailors initial acknowledgement to reason of contact, else 0. Saying I can help is not a tailored acknowledgement. Tailored acknowledgement shows empathy and understanding. Example for a guest unable to cancel an order would be “I’m sorry to hear you can’t cancel your order, let me see how I can help\n\n\n### 11) Avoid repetition\n> Sources: transcript\n> Goal: Educator does not repeat previously asked for or discussed information\n> Scoring:\n- 1 pt: Avoids asking guest to repeat previously provided info; if repeated, acknowledges & thanks\n- 0 pt: Asks guests to repeat information and does not acknowledge the inconvenience\n\n### 12) Hold times\n> Sources: transcript\n> Goal: Enables good guest experience by providing a \"by-when\" before holds or research time\n> Scoring:\n- 1 pt: Always provides clear guidance if they need to take time or put the guest on hold and sets proper expectations that they adhere to.\n- 0 pt: If they do not provide notice of hold or long pauses or if they do not adhere to expectations. i.e. I will be back in a minute, and does not return for 3 minutes.\n\n### 13) Timely responses\n> Sources: transcript timestamps\n> Goal: Responds within channel expectations, Phone ≤ 3s, Live chat ≤ 10s, Apple for business ≤ 10s. (If timestamps unavailable, mark insufficient_evidence.)\n> Scoring\n- 1 pt: If ALWAYS responds according to SLAs, or is clear in justifying why when they are out of SLA\n- 0 pt: Misses SLAs and does not provide any justification to the guest\n\n### 14) PCI components validated\n> Sources: transcript only.\n> Goal: Educator validates ≥3 of 5 PCI components effectively (name, phone, order number, address, email). If there is prior chat history available where a previous agent already captured this information but the agent asked again, assign 0 points. \n> Scoring: \n1 pt - if 3 or more of the 5 components are captured\n0 pt - if less than 3 of 5 are captured or the guest was asked repeated information.\n\n### 15) Product-related offering\n> Sources: transcript\n> Goal: educator proactively drives revenue by making an effort to place another order, recommending products, suggesting DE appointment, explaining Science of Feel etc.\n> Scoring:\n1 pt - proactively drove incremental revenue in anyway. Offering to re place an order counts.\n0 pt - just stayed on task, did not make any new offers\n\n### 16) Resolution Offered\n> Sources: transcript + knowledge articles\n> Goal: Educator supported the Guests needs by offering a resolution that aligns to Acme Corp policy, training, and/or knowledge base, or providing a resolution that supports Guest experience when necessary for an identified exception in SOP \n> Scoring: \n2 pt - if the resolution aligns to policy/training/KB OR if its justified by exception because the agent pursued the best possible Guest experience. \n1 pt - as long as an appropriate resolution was offered\n0 pt - if no resolution or a completely incorrect resolution was provided\n\n### 17) Resolution set-up\n> Sources: transcript + knowledge articles + item records\n> Goal: Educator accurately created the Reason of Contact in Salesforce\n> Scoring:\n2 pt - Correct Reason of Contact is listed in Salesforce case\n1 pt - If reason of contact is relatively correct\n0 pt - If reason of contact is wrong\n\n###System Use Scores###\n> Sources: salesforce case record\n### 19) Reason of Contact: Assign 1 pt if the reason of contact field correctly reflects the conversation, else 0.\n### 20) Case Status: Assign 1pt if case status correct (status is \"closed\" if no follow-up; \"waiting on guest\" if guest follow-up needed), else 0.\n### 21) Case Subject Line: Assign 1pt if subject field accurately reflects purpose, else 0.\n### 22) Guest Profile: Assign 1pt if phone in case matches transcript mention (if phone was mentioned), else 0.\n### 23) Guest shipping address: Assign 1pt if address captured correctly IF the guest shared it in the interaction, else 0.\n### 24) Supplementary Items: Assign 1pt if item records reflect all actions, questions, and suggestions, else 0.\n### 25) Timeline notes: Assign 1pt if case notes accurately capture the call and resolution, else 0.\n\n## INPUTS\nYou will receive:\n- transcript: full text of the interaction\n- sf_case: JSON of the Salesforce case record\n- kb_articles: concatenated text or array of relevant knowledge articles (policy/SOP)\n\n## DECISION RULES TO REDUCE HALLUCINATIONS\n- Cite exact snippets for every non-binary claim.\n- If a required datum is not explicitly present in the provided sources, set \"insufficient_evidence\": true and score 0 for that element; do NOT infer from brand common sense.\n- For timestamps/SLAs, only use explicit timing from transcript metadata; if none, mark insufficient_evidence.\n- For policy alignment, quote the specific KB passage used.\n\n## REQUIRED JSON TEMPLATE - COPY EXACTLY AND FILL VALUES\nIMPORTANT: Copy this exact structure. Do not omit any field. Every element must have \"insufficient_evidence\": true or false.\n{\n  \"agent_persona_summary\": \"1–3 sentences on strengths and weaknesses of this interaction backing up the scores provided.\",\n  \"elements\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"<insert the name of the scoring element>\",\n          \"element_id\": \"<insert the ID/number of the corresponding scoring element>\",\n          \"rationale\": \"<REQUIRED: Brief explanation of scoring decision based on the rubric definition>\",\n          \"score\": 0,\n          \"insufficient_evidence\": <boolean true/false value if evidence was present to support the score>,\n          \"evidence\": [<provide the supporting snippet from the transcript, knowledge article, or case value that backs up the scoring rationale>]\n        },\n        ...\n      ]\n}\n  \n## FINAL VALIDATION CHECKLIST - CRITICAL\nBefore returning your JSON, verify EVERY SINGLE ELEMENT has these 6 fields:\n1. \"name\" (string)\n2. \"element_id\" (string)\n3. \"score\" (integer) \n4. \"insufficient_evidence\" (boolean - true or false)\n5. \"rationale\" (string)\n6. \"evidence\" (array of strings)\n\nMISSING ANY OF THESE FIELDS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR.
